# What is Dog?
## Dogs were probably the first tame animals. They have accompanied humans for at least 20,000 years and possibly as many as 40,000. Scientists generally agree that all dogs, domestic and wild, share a common wolf ancestor; at some point grey wolves and dogs went on their separate evolutionary ways.
