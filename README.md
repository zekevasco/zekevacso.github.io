# What is Dog?
## Dogs were probably the first tame animals. They have accompanied humans for at least 20,000 years and possibly as many as 40,000. Scientists generally agree that all dogs, domestic and wild, share a common wolf ancestor; at some point grey wolves and dogs went on their separate evolutionary ways.

### What is Rhodesian Ridgeback
The Rhodesian Ridgeback is a large scenthound and sighthound dog breed bred in the Southern Africa region. Its forebears can be traced to the semi-domesticated ridged hunting and guardian dogs of the Khoikhoi. These were interbred with European dogs by the early colonists of the Cape Colony of southern Africa.
